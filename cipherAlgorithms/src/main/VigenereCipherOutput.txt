THE NEON GLOW OF THE CITY BLED INTO THE INKY BLACKNESS OF THE DESERT SKY, PAINTING A SURREAL CANVAS ON THE HORIZON. A LONE TUMBLEWEED, CAUGHT IN THE RELENTLESS DESERT WIND, BOUNCED PAST A WEATHERED SIGN THAT PROCLAIMED IN FADED RED PAINT, "THE OASIS: 10 MILES."  INSIDE A BEAT-UP PICKUP TRUCK, RATTLING ALONG THE CRACKED ASPHALT, MAYA GRIPPED THE STEERING WHEEL, HER KNUCKLES WHITE. DUST DEVILS DANCED IN THE DISTANCE, SWIRLING MINIATURE TORNADOES THAT WHISPERED TALES OF FORGOTTEN TRAVELERS. THE AIR CONDITIONING WHEEZED ITS LAST, LEAVING A STIFLING HEAT THAT CLUNG TO MAYA LIKE A SECOND SKIN.  HER GAZE DARTED BETWEEN THE ENDLESS EXPANSE OF SAND AND THE WORN MAP CRUMPLED ON THE PASSENGER SEAT. DOUBT GNAWED AT HER - WAS THIS A FOOL'S ERRAND? YET, THE MEMORY OF HER GRANDMOTHER'S STORIES, OF A HIDDEN OASIS TEEMING WITH LIFE, PULSED IN HER VEINS. IT WAS A LEGEND SOME SCOFFED AT, A DESERT MIRAGE, THEY CALLED IT.  BUT MAYA, FUELED BY A YEARNING TO CONNECT WITH HER HERITAGE, REFUSED TO LET GO OF HOPE.  AS THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN DIPPED BELOW THE HORIZON, CASTING LONG, SKELETAL SHADOWS ACROSS THE DUNES, A FLICKER OF MOVEMENT CAUGHT HER EYE. SQUINTING, SHE SAW A CLUSTER OF PALM TREES, THEIR SILHOUETTE ETCHED AGAINST THE DARKENING SKY.  A SURGE OF ADRENALINE COURSED THROUGH HER - COULD IT BE? WITH A RENEWED DETERMINATION, MAYA PRESSED ON, THE DESERT WHISPERING ITS SECRETS, URGING HER FORWARD TOWARDS THE PROMISE OF A LIFE-GIVING HAVEN.
